📊 Data Analytics Project
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI.
The goal is to load and analyze a dataset, clean and prepare the data, extract insights using SQL queries, and present key findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

This project highlights practical skills required for Data Analyst / Data Scientist roles.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data related to business metrics (sales, customers, transactions, etc.).

Source: (Public dataset / Company-provided dataset / Kaggle — Shopping Tends AAnd Customer Behavior Dataset.csv)

Format: CSV

Size: Medium-sized dataset suitable for analysis and visualization.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python – Data loading, EDA, and data cleaning

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

PostgreSQL – Data storage and SQL analysis

SQL – Data querying and aggregation

Power BI – Interactive dashboard and data visualization

🔄 Project Steps
